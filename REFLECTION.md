Were your predictions right?
The first two predictions were correct but I wsa wrong about if caffeine helped impove my focus.

What surprised you?
What surprised me the most was that caffeine did not help focus.  Although I inputted the data retroactively and not day by day(whcih woudlve been more accurate) I attemped to be as hionest as possible.  Mayvbe if I checked the relationship between sleeping hours or screen time to focus I would be able to find a correlation.

What was tricky or rewarding?
One part that gave me some issues was keeping track of all the variable names but by making them more clear it helped me keep track of them better.  It was rewarding to see that when i chnaged my naming habbits it made the coding easier.  

How did using your own data change things?
It woudlve been beter if i recordede this data throught the course of the week because tis hanrd to retroactively figure out how much caffeine or my focus level but i was able to accurately input sleep data since I already track that through a fitness device.  It was cool to use my own data because I appreciated the results more.
